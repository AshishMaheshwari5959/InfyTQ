Use Luhn algorithm to validate a credit card number.


A credit card number has 16 digits, the last digit being the check digit. A credit card number can be validated using Luhn algorithm as follows:


Step 1a: From the second last digit (inclusive), double the value of every second digit.
Suppose the credit card number is 1456734512345698.
Take the double of 9,5,3,1,4,7,5 and 1
i.e., 18, 10, 6, 2, 8, 14, 10 and 2

Note: If any number is greater than 9, then sum the digits of that number.
i.e., 9, 1, 6, 2, 8, 5 ,1 and 2

Step 1b: Sum the numbers obtained in Step 1a.
i.e., 34

Step 2: Sum the remaining digits in the credit card and add it with the sum from Step 1b.
i.e., 34 + (8+6+4+2+5+3+6+4) = 72

Step 3: If the total is divisible by 10 then the number is valid else it is not valid.


Write a function, validate_credit_card_number(), which accepts a 16 digit credit card number and returns true if it is valid as per Luhnâ€™s algorithm or false, if it is invalid. Also write the pytest test cases to test the program.
