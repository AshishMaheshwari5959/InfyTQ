What is the output of the below code snippet?
num1=100
num2=200
num3=6
if(5>=num3):
    if(num1>100 or num2>150):
        print("1")
elif(num1>=100 and num2>150):
    print("2")
else:
    print("3")PythonCopy


2

Considering num1=100, num2=200, num3=6.
For '2' to be printed, control should reach line 8.
Line 8 is reached when the 'if' statement in line 4 evaluate to false and 'elif' statement in line 7 evaluate to true.
Line 4 is evaluating to false and line 7 is evaluating to true.
Hence this is the answer.
