# Solution

#PF-Tryout
import random
def guess_number(number_in_mind):
    x,y = 1,10
    z = random.randrange(x,y)
    if number_in_mind > z :
        print ('Number is low')
    elif number_in_mind < z :
        print ('Number is high')
    else:    
        print ('You have got it right!!!')

#Provide different values for number_in_mind and test your program
guess_number(4)
